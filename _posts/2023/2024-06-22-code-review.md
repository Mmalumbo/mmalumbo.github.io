## What is a self-review?

Take a good look at your code, catch any silly mistakes, clean it up, and make sure it’s ready to impress the rest of the team or the internet. Think of it as a final check to make sure your code isn’t showing up to the party like Manganya!

## Background

After graduating from the University (UNIMA, now [MUBAS](https://www.mubas.ac.mw/)) back in 2018, I learned the importance of self-reviews early in my career. Self-reviews are crucial before committing to GitHub or any form of version control for several reasons.

> Taking the time to review your code can help you catch errors, improve the quality of your work, and ensure that your contributions integrate smoothly with the existing codebase.
